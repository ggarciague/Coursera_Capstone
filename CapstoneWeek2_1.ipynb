    "According to CONASET [^1] (Chilean Transit Security National Commission), the number of traffic accidents was close to 90000 last year, causing the death of 1617 people and near 57000 were injured. [^2]\n",
    "The main goal of this project is creating a tool able to assert under certain conditions -such as weather, time of the day or the type of road- predict the severity of car accidents (causing injuries or property damage). \n",
    "\n",
    "With this proposed tool, it may be possible to set alerts for drivers and public services such as police, fire departments, hospitals and road workers to assess the risks and set policies aiming to reduce the number of road accidents, saving lives and uncountable resources to the community as a whole, either public funding or private property. This tool may also be used in the insurance industry to evaluate the risk rate in several locations under certain speficic shared conditions.\n",
